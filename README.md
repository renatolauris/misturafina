# misturafina

The goal of misturafina is to create a first package from my own as an exercise for Computational Statistics classes.
The package misturafina contains functions which execute some numerical optimization algorithms (simulated annealing, Estimation and Maximization - EM, Newton-Raphson) to estimate parameters from multivariate normal mix distributions. Also offers likelihood function and random samples generator for these mix distributions.

## Installation

You can install misturafina in its development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("renatolauris/misturafina")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(misturafina)
## basic example code
```
